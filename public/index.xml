      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Bhushan. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a Tech Intern at Turtlemint company. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code for about more than 5 years now. I love it, and I hope I will continue doing it.
To name a few accomplishments, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Google Summer of Code Student at coala organization and have been very good in competitive programming. I was a round 3 qualifier for Google codejam.
That&amp;rsquo;s about it.</description>
